This form allows Girl Scouts to collect and process requests for cookies. Your job is to turn this form into an application. Instead of filling out this form, Girl Scouts of America wants to put a computer in high traffic locations with a program that allows customers to fill out a cookie request. Reference the form pictured above to determine what data is necessary from the user.
